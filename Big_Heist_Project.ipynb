    "## Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Given list of bank locations, how much money each one holds and the time it would take to rob each one, you need to apply your hard-won algorithm knowledge to make as much profit as possible! _I bet you didn't think that data science could be this profitable!_\n",
    "\n",
    "You will design and write a solution to an NP-Had algorithm to this problem\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need to apply all the knowledge learned up to now to get the best possible result at this task given a large list of banks and 3 minutes to run your algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "The list of banks is in `data/bank_data.csv`. This is what the data looks like.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csv\n",
    "id, x_coordinate, y_coordinate, money, time (hr)\n",
    "0, 11.4, 3.3, 5000, 0.6\n",
    "1, 6.9, 7.1, 15000, 0.3\n",
    "2, 1.4, 13.2, 900, 1.1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You have **24 hours** to make as much money as possible and then escape.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "- Your run can start anywhere on the map but it has to end at the **helicopter escape zone**: coordinates (0,0)\n",
    "    - If you try to rob too many banks and can't get to the helicopter in 24 hours, you get caught and go to jail.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Your solution is a list or array of integers (eg. `[580, 433, 24, 998]`) where the numbers are the IDs of each banks. The ID of each bank is their index (their row index).\n",
    "\n",
    "- You travel between banks at 30 km/h. You have to travel from one bank to the next!\n",
    "    - Remember the formula to calculate the distance between two points.\n",
    "    - The coordinates are in kilometers.\n",
    "        - So (1, 1) and (1, 2) are one kilometer apart. \n",
    "        - This would take 1 / 30 hour = 2 minutes to travel\n",
    "\n",
    "- Your solution should be an approximative/heuristic algorithm\n",
    "    - This problem is NP-Hard, you won't find a fast enough algorithm that has the perfect solution\n",
    "    - It doesn't need to find the best solution\n",
    "    - Find the best solution you can!\n",
    "\n",
    "- Your solution has to run on a common laptop in under 3 minutes for the 10,000 cities dataset\n",
    "    - You can use everything you want to achieve this:\n",
    "        - Use numpy, pandas, functions, algorithms\n",
    "        - You can use parallelism\n",
    "        - Use optimied libraries (pandas, numba, scipy, etc.)\n",
    "    - Test your code on **small subsets** of the data so they run fast\n",
    "        - Then scale your code up to bigger chunks of the data\n",
    "\n",
    "- Your input is a pandas dataframe with the bank data. Your output is a list of bank IDs in order that you rob them:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# example\n",
    "df = pd.read_csv('bank_data.csv')\n",
    "robber_algorithm(df)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Output is a list of bank IDs\n",
    "[OUTPUT] --> [664, 2341, 26, 998, 9583, 24, 1, 444, 6783]\n",
